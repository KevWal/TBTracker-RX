/************************************************************************************
* TBTracker-RX - roel@kroes.com
* 
* A mobile software platform for receiving LoRa transmissions and uploading those 
* to amateur.sondehub.org. The software is designed to run on the esp32 platform. 
* A TTGO T-Beam would be ideal. It has WiFi connectivity and a simple web interface
* 
* First adjust the settings in the settings file.
* 
* Be sure you run the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
*
* v0.0.7
* 03-02-2023: The link to Sondehub in the web interface now opens in a new window
* 03-02-2023: Software now works also without WiFi (data on Serial output or OLED display)
*
* v0.0.6
* 29-JAN-2023: Added a parser for the APRS packets to display on the Serial interface, webinterface and SSD1306 display
*
* v0.0.5
* 21-JAN-2023: Print length of received packet in the Serial monitor
* 21-JAN-2023: Check if the received packet is indeed a HAB telemetry packet
* 21-JAN-2023: Removed the RAW telemetry string from the Serial monitor to avoid double info and unreadable characters
* 21-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa-APRS packets
* 21-JAN-2023: Added a packet Log trail in the web interface
*  
* v0.0.4
* 14-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa Mode 5 (Explicit mode, Error coding 4:8, Bandwidth 41.7kHz, SF 11, Low data rate optimize off)
* 14-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa Mode 3 (Explicit mode, Error coding 4:6, Bandwidth 250kHz,   SF 7, Low data rate optimize off)
* 20-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa Mode 0 (Explicit mode, Error coding 4:8, Bandwidth 20.8kHz, SF 11, Low data rate optimize on)
* 20-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa Mode 1 (Implicit mode, Error coding 4:5, Bandwidth 20.8kHz,  SF 6, Low data rate optimize off)
* 20-JAN-2023: Added support for showing and changing the LoRa Mode in the webinterface
* 20-JAN-2023: Solved several bugs
* 20-JAN-2023: Added autotune to the radio (based on the frquency error calculated by the radio)
*
* v0.0.3
* 06-JAN-2023: Added SNR, RSSI to the web interface
* 06-JAN-2023: Added time since latest packet to the web interface
* 06-JAN-2023: Made the Google Maps open in a new window
* 06-JAN-2023: Solved several reported bugs / unexpected behaviour
* 07-JAN-2023: Changed some UI language. (I apologize, English is not my native language)
*
* v0.0.2
* 23-DEC-2022: Added upload result to the web interface
* 23-DEC-2022: "comment" string is now disabled by default
* 23-DEC-2022: Try to determine if the packet received is an actual HAB packet or an invalid or unknown packet
* 23-DEC-2022: Changed the wording of "Test mode" in the webinterface
*
* v0.0.1: 
* 19-DEC-2022: Changed to x.y.z version numbering
* 19-DEC-2022: Moved version number to TBTracker-rx.ino from settings.h
* 19-DEV-2022: The OLED display will now show frequency updates
* 19-DEC-2022: Added a way to change the DEVFLAG in the webinterface 
*
* v0.1ÃŸ:
* 18-DEC-2022: Initial version, released in the Facebook HAB-NL group
